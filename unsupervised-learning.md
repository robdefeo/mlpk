# Unsupervised Learning

What is unsupervised learning? TODO:

**How can I use data more usefully?** TODO:
With text an example is to take 11 words in order, make a copy of it, then remove the middle word and replace that removed word with a random one. In effect there are two sets of text one that makes sense and one that does not, these data sets can then be given a label, e.g. 1 / 0.

**How do find a use case for unsupervised learning?** TODO:
Come up with a task that is as close to a the task you will eventually be interested in as possible that does not require labels or labels are really cheap to generate.
