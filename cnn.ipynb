    "**What is a CCN best used for?** TODO:\n",
    "CNN are very good for percuptual problems such as image classification. \n",
    "It is a very flexible and used to solve many problems, it is particularly useful when there is some \"ordered data\" of some description, with this characteristic it is used for image recognition as well as NLP.\n",

    "**What is a convolutional layer?** TODO:\n",
    "For images they are a representation of spacial relationships, its all about how items related to each other from the point of view of position.\n",

    "**How does a 1D convolution different from a 2D convolution?**\n",
    "It depends on the data, e.g. image = 2D, sentence = 1D\n",
