# Neural Network (NN)

**What is a NN?**

**Why are NN important?**
They are universal approximation machines, it's to mathmatically handle any type of problem, 
They are an infinitly flexible function, meaning that it can be used to solve any type of problem.



**If a NN can theoretically approximate anything why does model architecture and activations even matter?** TODO:
It would take an impossibly long time to complete a satisfactory calculation.


**What data do you need to train a NN?**
You need data that shows examples of what you want to predict.
