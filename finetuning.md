# Fine Tuning

**What is fine tuning?**
Take an existing model and adapt it to a new but similar problem.

**Why fine tune a model rather than train a new one?**
Models can take a long time to train, fine tuning means it does not need to start with random weights shortening it's training time.   Authors create a model to solve a problem, after training the model has learnt a lot of relevant information needed to solve the problem.  You can take advantage of this knowledge by selecting an appropriate model and fine tuning it.

**How does fine tuning work?**

**What are the limits of fine tuning?**

**Is there an easy way to fine tune models?**
For MxNet and image classification you can use https://github.com/knjcode/mxnet-finetuner
