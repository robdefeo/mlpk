# Generalize

**What does generalize mean?** 
A measure of how well the model has learnt to understand the relevant parameters of a model.

**Why is it important that a model generalizes well?**
If not then it will not perform well against unseen data, the goal of machine learning is perform against unseen data or generalize well.
